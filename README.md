# Distributed Systems
## Implementation of Remote Procedure Calls

The properties of a RPC has been implemented in this project.

The components of an RPC thus implemented are present in the corresponding folders.

- [RPC Server](https://github.com/WickedBrat/rpc-implementation/tree/master/RPC-Server)
- [RPC Client](https://github.com/WickedBrat/rpc-implementation/tree/master/RPC-Client)
- [Registery Service](https://github.com/WickedBrat/rpc-implementation/tree/master/Registry-Service)

In order to successfully operate the project, the servers must be port forwarded using [NgRok](https://ngrok.com/). This will provide us with the public URLs of the applications.

**The setup instructions for the corresponding components are present in the corresponding folders' README.md**
